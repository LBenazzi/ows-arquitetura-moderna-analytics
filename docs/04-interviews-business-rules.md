# Interview about Business Rules {Transforming Data}

1. Customer Insights and Segmentation

Interviewer: Can you tell us about the type of insights you’d like to gain from customer data?
Business Owner: We want to segment customers to better understand their behavior and offer personalized financial products. For example, we could identify customers with higher balances and create exclusive offers for them.

Interviewer: That’s a great idea. Would you like to include transaction data or account types in this segmentation?
Business Owner: Absolutely. Transaction patterns and account balances are key. We’d also like to know which customers are more likely to save regularly.

Business Rule:
* Segment customers into tiers: Basic, Silver, Gold, and Platinum based on account balance thresholds.
* Use spending patterns to identify customers for targeted promotions.

Data Used:
* customers.json
* accounts.json
* transactions.json

2. Fraud Detection and Prevention

Interviewer: Fraud prevention is critical. Could you describe your current pain points and what you’d like to address?
Fraud Analyst: Right now, identifying unusual transaction patterns is slow. We’d like a system that flags suspicious transactions automatically, especially if they’re made in unfamiliar locations or during odd hours.

Interviewer: That makes sense. Should this include digital activity data, such as login attempts?
Fraud Analyst: Definitely. If there’s suspicious login activity, like multiple failed attempts, it should trigger alerts.

Business Rule:
* Flag high-value transactions outside usual locations or times.
* Detect multiple failed login attempts within a 5-minute window.

Data Used:
* transactions.json
* digital_activity.json

3. Loan Default Prediction

Interviewer: What challenges are you facing in managing loans?
Lending Manager: Predicting defaults is a big issue. We need to identify customers who are likely to miss payments before it happens.

Interviewer: Would combining income and spending data with credit card utilization help?
Lending Manager: Yes, that would be ideal. If a customer’s debt-to-income ratio exceeds a safe threshold, we should flag them as high risk.

Business Rule:
* Flag customers with a debt-to-income ratio above 40%.
* Use repayment delays as indicators for potential defaults.

Data Used:
* loans.json
* transactions.json
* credit_cards.json

4. Branch Performance Analytics

Interviewer: How do you currently measure branch performance?
Branch Manager: We look at transaction volumes and revenue, but the data is often outdated. We need timely insights to make decisions.

Interviewer: Would a ranking system for branches based on activity and revenue help?
Branch Manager: Yes, and it would also be helpful to identify branches that are underperforming.

Business Rule:
* Rank branches by transaction volume and revenue.
* Highlight branches with low activity for potential optimization.

Data Used:
* branches.json
* accounts.json
* transactions.json

5. Investment Portfolio Analysis

Interviewer: What kind of insights are you looking for in investment data?
Wealth Manager: We want to understand which investment products are performing well and identify customers who might need re-engagement for dormant investments.

Interviewer: Would tracking returns by investment type be useful?
Wealth Manager: Yes, we could optimize our offerings based on those insights.

Business Rule:
* Track total value of active investments by type.
* Identify customers with dormant investments for re-engagement campaigns.

Data Used:
* investments.json
* customers.json

6. Credit Card Spending Analysis

Interviewer: How do you analyze credit card usage?
Card Services Manager: We look at utilization rates, but we’re missing opportunities to engage customers who aren’t using their credit cards to their full potential.

Interviewer: Would a cashback or promotional campaign for high-value spending categories help?
Card Services Manager: Yes, and we could also flag customers nearing their credit limits for cross-selling opportunities.

Business Rule:
* Identify customers with low utilization (<30%) for promotional campaigns.
* Offer targeted cashback programs for high-spending categories.

Data Used:
* credit_cards.json
* transactions.json

7. Compliance and Regulatory Reporting

Interviewer: What are the main challenges in compliance reporting?
Compliance Officer: Meeting regulatory requirements like AML reporting can be slow and manual. Automating these reports would save a lot of time.

Interviewer: Would validating active customers for KYC compliance improve efficiency?
Compliance Officer: Absolutely. It’s crucial to ensure all active accounts meet regulatory standards.

Business Rule:
* Automate reporting of transactions exceeding 10,000 BRL.
* Validate that all active customers have completed KYC.

Data Used:
* compliance.json
* transactions.json

8. Digital Banking Adoption

Interviewer: How do you measure the success of digital banking initiatives?
Digital Banking Manager: We look at usage metrics, but we need to identify customers who aren’t engaging digitally and re-engage them.

Interviewer: Would correlating activity with transaction volumes help?
Digital Banking Manager: Yes, it would show whether digital engagement translates to revenue growth.

Business Rule:
* Identify customers who haven’t logged in within the last 6 months.
* Optimize server capacity based on peak usage times.

Data Used:
* digital_activity.json
* customers.json

9. Revenue Forecasting

Interviewer: What’s your biggest challenge in revenue forecasting?
Finance Manager: Estimating revenue from loans, credit cards, and transaction fees is complex, especially with variable customer behavior.

Interviewer: Would using historical trends and customer growth rates help refine forecasts?
Finance Manager: Yes, that would give us a more accurate picture of future revenue streams.

Business Rule:
* Use historical transaction fees to project monthly revenue.
* Forecast loan and credit card interest income based on outstanding balances.

Data Used:
* transactions.json
* loans.json
* credit_cards.json

10. Cross-Departmental Insights

Interviewer: How do departments currently collaborate on data insights?
Business Owner: Collaboration is limited. For example, the lending team doesn’t have easy access to credit card data, which could help identify cross-selling opportunities.

Interviewer: Would a unified platform to share insights help?
Business Owner: Absolutely. It would unlock a lot of potential for targeted offers and better customer engagement.

Business Rule:
* Identify customers with high credit card usage but no active loans for personal loan promotions.
* Suggest investment products to high-income customers without portfolios.

Data Used:
* customers.json
* credit_cards.json
* loans.json
* investments.json
