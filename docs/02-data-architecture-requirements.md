# Data Architecture Requirements

This document outlines the fundamental requirements for the data architecture of the banking system, focusing on scalability, multi-tenancy, data democracy, data security, and data governance.

1. Scalability
Objective: Ensure the architecture can handle growing data volumes, increasing user demands, and system complexities without performance degradation.
* Key Requirements:
  * Horizontal and vertical scaling of storage and compute resources.
  * Support for high-throughput data ingestion (e.g., batch and real-time).
  * Auto-scaling mechanisms for dynamic workloads (e.g., cloud-native solutions like AWS Lambda, Kubernetes).
  * Partitioning and sharding for large datasets to optimize read/write performance.
  * Monitoring and alerting tools to track performance bottlenecks.

2. Multi-Tenancy
Objective: Enable the system to support multiple tenants (e.g., business units, regions, or clients) while ensuring data isolation and optimal performance.
* Key Requirements:
  * Logical and physical data isolation between tenants using techniques such as schema-based or table-based segregation.
  * Resource allocation policies to prevent one tenant from monopolizing resources.
  * Customizable metadata management to tag tenant-specific data for easy identification.
  * Tenant-level access controls for fine-grained permissions.
  * Support for tenant-specific configurations and scaling.

3. Data Democracy
Objective: Facilitate self-service data access and empower users across departments while maintaining data integrity and security.
* Key Requirements:
  * Unified data catalog for centralized discovery of datasets and metadata.
  * User-friendly query tools and APIs for data exploration and reporting.
  * Training programs and documentation to enable non-technical users to work with data effectively.
  * Data lineage tracking for understanding data provenance and transformations.
  * Collaboration features for sharing insights, reports, and dashboards.

4. Data Security
Objective: Protect sensitive information and ensure compliance with regulatory standards (e.g., LGPD, GDPR, PCI DSS).
* Key Requirements:
  * Encryption:
  * At-rest: Encrypt stored data using algorithms like AES-256.
  * Data Masking:
    * Mask sensitive fields (e.g., CPF, CNPJ, credit card numbers) in datasets.
  * Audit Logs:
    * Maintain detailed logs of access and modification activities for audit purposes.
  * Security Testing:
    * Regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

5. Data Governance
Objective: Establish processes and policies to manage data availability, usability, integrity, and compliance.
* Key Requirements:
  * Data Quality:
    * Automated data quality checks for completeness, accuracy, and consistency.
      * Anomalies detection tools for identifying incorrect or missing data.
  * Master Data Management (MDM):
    * Maintain a single source of truth for key entities like customers, accounts, and branches.
  * Compliance Monitoring:
    * Automated validation of data against regulatory standards.
      * Support for maintaining compliance-related metadata.
  * Data Retention Policies:
    * Define and enforce policies for data archiving and deletion.
  * Governance Framework:
    * Appoint data stewards for enforcing governance policies.
    * Periodic reviews of governance practices to adapt to evolving business needs.
